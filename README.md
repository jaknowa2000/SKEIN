# SKEIN
Skein is hash function based on Threefish block cipher. Skein was a finalist of a NIST competition.
Here is an implementation of this hash function and basic brutal attacks on it i.e. (collision finding, preimage attack).
Here is also a function to generate pseudo-random data.


The documentation of this hash function you can find here https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/skein.pdf.
